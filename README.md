# Aless-Website

Hi there !

This is the source code of my website, created on February 25 2021.
I wanted to host it on GitHub, because I wanted to use MY HTML skills to create my website, not a stupid graphical editor without all the features I want.

Also, here is the link to my website:

# Contributions

If you want to report a bug, or suggest something, then you can go to the "Issues" tab and click the "New issue" button.

Or, if you want to add your code instead of reporting (Which is better), you can fork this repository, add your code, create a "Pull Request", and I will review your commit(s).

# The softwares I am using

I use Visual Studio Code as my IDE, Firefox to preview my website on localhost (With <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">this extension</a>), and finally, GitHub Desktop, to commit the changes to my website.


# Enjoy!
