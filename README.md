# Aless Website

Hi there !

This is the source code of my website, created on February 25, 2021.
I wanted to host it on GitHub, because I always wanted to use my HTML skills to create my own website, without graphical editors or CSS frameworks.

Also, here is the link to my website:

## Contributions

If you want to report a bug, or suggest something, click "Issues" and then click "New issue".

Or, if you want to add your code instead of reporting (Which is better), you can fork this repository, add your code, create a "Pull Request", and I will review your commit(s).

## The softwares I use

I use Visual Studio Code as my IDE, ~Firefox~ Microsoft Edge to preview my website on localhost (With <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">this extension</a>), and finally, GitHub Desktop, to commit changes to my website.


### Enjoy!
