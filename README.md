# Aless website

This is the source code of my website that I created on February 25th, 2021. I always wanted to use my web development skills to create my own website, without graphical editors (drag-and-drop/[WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG 'Acronym for "what you see is what you get"')) and/or CSS frameworks, which led me to creating this repository.

## Contributions

There are 2 ways you can contribute to my website:

1. You can report a bug and/or suggest something by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/AlessGoss/alessgoss.github.io/issues/new).

2. You can contribute to its source code by [forking this repository](https://github.com/AlessGoss/alessgoss.github.io/fork), committing your changes, and finally, [creating a pull request](https://github.com/AlessGoss/alessgoss.github.io/compare). I will review your commit(s) and merge your pull request if everything is okay.

## Software I use

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as my IDE, [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox) to preview my website, and finally, [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to commit changes to it.

### Enjoy!
